## Introduction
It is in the interest of many people and companies to predict the price movement and direction of the stock market. Also, the stock market is a vital component of a countryâ€™s economy. It is one of the most significant opportunities for investment by companies and investors. Stock traders need to predict trends in the stock market to determine when to sell or buy a stock. To see profits, stock traders need to acquire those stocks whose prices are expected to rise shortly and sell those stocks whose prices are expected to decline. If traders can adequately predict the stock trends and patterns, they can earn a considerable profit margin. However, stock markets are very volatile and, consequently, difficult to predict.

Stock prices tick up and down constantly due to fluctuations in supply and demand. The relationship between supply and demand is highly sensitive to the news of the moment. Chasing the news is not a good stock-picking strategy for the individual investor. But professional traders react in anticipation of an event. Government economic reports are always news, as they suggest the strength or weakness of the economy, the consumer, and key industry sectors.

Negative news will normally cause people to sell stocks. Positive news will normally cause individuals to buy stocks. professional traders and manipulators use a number of sources of information like Government economic reports, Company and industry news, and Gossips.

Professional traders spend much of their time trying to anticipate the next news cycle so that they can buy or sell stocks before the real numbers are released.

There are several TV channels today that track the live movement of the stocks throughout the day. The channels also provide information about various stocks from a sector and their speculation. Coverage of economic events that might affect market returns, like recessions, fluctuates over time.
